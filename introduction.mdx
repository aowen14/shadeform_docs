## The GPU Market

The rise of ChatGPT and growth of open-source models have caused GPU demand to skyrocket while supply falls short due to manufacturing and distribution constraints. These unique factors have yielded the following market conditions:

- Prices for the same GPU can be magnitudes (up to 5x) different between cloud providers.
- Low A100 and H100 availability across all cloud providers.
- Growing number of GPU Cloud Providers with disparate APIs and UI.

## Why Use Shadeform?

Shadeform is a single pane of glass for the entire cloud GPU market’s pricing and availability. When ML engineers need GPUs for their workloads, Shadeform makes it easy to find the best priced and available GPUs for their needs. By providing a single API and UI for all clouds, Shadeform unifies the user experience of all cloud providers into a single easy-to-use platform that saves time on integration and effort on switching cloud providers.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances/create \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: <x-api-key>' \
--data '{
    "cloud": "aws",
    "name": "cool-gpu-server",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "shade_cloud": true,
    "shade_instance_type": "A100x8"
}'
```

## Launch GPU Instances with Shadeform

You can use Shadeform to deploy GPU instances into your own, existing cloud accounts or to deploy into Shade Cloud - Shadeform-owned accounts with each cloud provider. Using Shade Cloud eliminates the need for creating cloud accounts with each of the providers, setting up billing over and over, and wrangling with quotas. Once an instance is launched, you’ll see the instance and its access information on the Shadeform console.
